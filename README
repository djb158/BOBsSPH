BOBsSPH: A CFD software package that performs Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH) in a linux-MPI environment.

This is a first-attempt, preliminary investigation into the world of SPH, with several goals in mind:
  a. learn SPH
  b. learn how to code MPI in a C-linux environment
  c. ultimately and hopefully get some useful results concerning the decay of strong shocks from a large atmospheric explosion through to the linear far-field.
  d. learn how to use puppet to manage my nodes.

So far:
  1. have adapted ANN nearest neighbour technique (David M. Mount and Sunil Arya) to perform nearest neighbour estimation, but the ANN libs that I am using is not multi-threading, so have to place locations of all particles on a single node and then do the calcaultion, -will change this. I have included 'code blocks'  in main.c to send and receive data from the neighbour node.
  2. have successfully propagated a 2D shock using the Sigalottti configurtion

  3. have successfully modelled KH billows in shear flows.
  4. have created my own binary output files.  Daniel Price of Monash Uni. has kindly included a module in the splash libraries to allow a graphical display of the results.
